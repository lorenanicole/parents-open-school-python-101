# Parents Open School: Writing Our First Python Program

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook I wrote for [Parents Open School](https://www.parentsopenschool.com/) to showcase how to write our first Python program to: find a cat image and find a cat image by category.

The project uses [the Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/thanks), which is free to use, and is Python 3 powered!

To get started:

1. Register for the [CatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/thanks)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. Setup a `.env` with `CAT_API_KEY` and set it equal to the API key you receive via email from the CatAPI
4. Power up the notebook via `jupyter notebook` OR navigate to `scripts/` and execute which ever of the scripts you like!
